We first create a socket object with the AF_INET and SOCK_STREAM parameters.
1> The AF_INET parameter is saying we are going to use a standard
IPv4 address or hostname, and SOCK_STREAM indicates that this will be a TCP
client.
 We then connect the client to the server <2> and send it some data <3>.
The last step is to receive some data back and print out the response <4>.
This is the simplest form of a TCP client, but the one you will write most
often.
In the above code snippet, we are making some serious assumptions
about sockets that you definitely want to be aware of. The first assumption
is that our connection will always succeed, and the second is that the
server is always expecting us to send data first (as opposed to servers that
expect to send data to you first and await your response). Our third assumption
is that the server will always send us data back in a timely fashion. We
make these assumptions largely for simplicityâ€™s sake.
